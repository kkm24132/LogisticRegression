## Recommendation
- Focus on Core Concepts
- Learn Mathematics behind algorithm(s)
- Apply using use cases and practice
- Leverage Python or R programming, and then move to cloud platforms (AWS Sagemaker or Azure ML or GCP ML or Watson or KNIME etc.)


## Approach
- Follow CRISP methodology
- Emphasis on EDA, Feature Engineering, Model Diagnostics and then go to Model Development, Model Evaluation
- Leverage statsmodels for statistical analysis, inferences for interpretation of coefficients, feature selections, model diagnostics etc.
- Leverage sklearn family for model solution, prediction, and further analysis of metrics for evaluation
